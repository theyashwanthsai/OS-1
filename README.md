# OS-1

Learning to build a simple operating system from scratch. This is basically a vibe learning project.


This repo was created back in feb 2023, but I never finished it. Now that I know what works best for me, I started this project again.

> This is a hobby project

I am learning OSdev using claude and cursor. I am also writing about it on my blog and youtube.
